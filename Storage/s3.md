## S3 Replication
 ###### CRR (Cross region replication)
 ###### SRR (Same region replication)

 S3 has two replication features which allow objects to be replicated between a SOURCE and DESTINATION buckets in the same or different AWS accounts

Cross-Region Replication (CRR) is the process used when Source and Destination are in different AWS regions

Same-Region Replication (SRR) is used when the buckets are in the same region.

This lesson introduces the theory, features and limitations of both of these methods.

##### S3 Encryption
This lesson steps through the various encryption options available within S3 and finishes by looking at default bucket encryption settings

Client-Side Encryption
SSE-C
SSE-S3
SSE-KMS
As part of the lesson we review how SSE-KMS impacts permissions and how it can achieve role separation.

## S3 Access point
Amazon S3 Access Points, a feature of S3, simplifies managing data access at scale for applications using shared data sets on S3. Access points are unique hostnames that customers create to enforce distinct permissions and network controls for any request made through the access point.

Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration can speed up content transfers to and from Amazon S3 by as much as 50-500% for long-distance transfer of larger objects. Customers who have either web or mobile applications with widespread users or applications hosted far away from their S3 bucket can experience long and variable upload and download speeds over the Internet. S3 Transfer Acceleration (S3TA) reduces the variability in Internet routing, congestion and speeds that can affect transfers, and logically shortens the distance to S3 for remote applications. S3TA improves transfer performance by routing traffic through Amazon CloudFrontâ€™s globally distributed Edge Locations and over AWS backbone networks, and by using network protocol optimizations. You can turn on S3TA with a few clicks in the S3 console, and test its benefits from your location with a speed comparison tool. With S3TA, you pay only for transfers that are accelerated.
